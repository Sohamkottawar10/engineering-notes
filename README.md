# Engineering Notes & Bug Journal

This repository is my personal knowledge base for software engineering,
machine learning systems, and research workflows.

It contains:
- Clear explanations of core concepts (Python, environments, ML systems)
- Postmortems of real bugs I encountered and fixed
- Practical debugging checklists and scripts
- Best practices for reproducible work on servers and clusters

The goal is to avoid repeating mistakes and to build long-term intuition.
